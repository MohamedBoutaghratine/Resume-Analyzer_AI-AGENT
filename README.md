## How It Works üöÄ  

1. **Embedding Model**  
   - Uses **HuggingFace Embeddings** (`sentence-transformers/all-mpnet-base-v2`) to create dense vector representations for resumes and job descriptions.  

2. **Large Language Model**  
   - Powered by **LLMs** like `llama-3.1-70b-versatile`, the agent generates insights, answers user queries, and categorizes skills.  

3. **Similarity Scoring**  
   - Computes **cosine similarity** between embedded vectors of resumes and job descriptions to determine the match percentage.  

4. **PDF Text Extraction**  
   - Extracts text from uploaded resumes using **PyPDF2** for seamless processing.
